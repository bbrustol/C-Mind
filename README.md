# C-Mind

With this application, I'd like to demonstrate my knowledge of Android. I tried to use the best practices available in the market to develop it.

I used MVVM, Kotlin, RX, and Dagger to reduce code lines and maintain a clean architecture. Besides that, I chose Kotlin because it is the official language now.

To help me make the app, I used some of the most used libraries on the market nowadays, like Retrofit and Glide.

For the layout, I decided to use different techniques for each activity/fragment/include tags. I included "Master Details" too, they work on resolutions of 900  width and over.

To finish, I used unit tests to guarantee my coding and have fewer bugs and glitches.
